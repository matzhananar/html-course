	<h1>Save Your Tears</h1>
	<pre>
	Ooh
    Na-na, yeah
    I saw you dancing in a crowded room
    You look so happy when I'm not with you
    But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
    A single teardrop falling from your eye
    I don't know why I run away
    I'll make you cry when I run away
    You could've asked me why I broke your heart
    You could've told me that you fell apart
    But you walked past me like I wasn't there
	And just pretended like you didn't care
	I don't know why I run away
	I'll make you cry when I run away
	Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
	Save your tears for another
	Save your tears for another day
	Save your tears for another day
	So, I made you think that I would always stay
	I said some things that I should never say
	Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
	And now you won't love me for a second…

	<h1>After Hours</h1>
 <pre>
 	[Verse 1]
	Thought I almost died in my dream again (Baby, almost died)
	Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
	I'm fallin' in too deep (Oh, oh)
	Without you, I can't sleep (Fallin' in)
	'Cause my heart belongs to you
	I'll risk it all for you
	I want you next to me
	This time, I'll never leave
	I wanna share babies
	Protection, we won't need
	Your body next to me
	Is just a memory
	I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
	Without you, I can't sleep
	Insomnia relieve, oh
	Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe

	[Verse 2]
	My darkest hours
	Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
	Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
	I turned into the man I used to be, to be
	Put myself to sleep
	Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
	Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
	I just wanted to call you and say, and say

	[Chorus]
	Oh, baby
	Where are you now when I need you most?
	I'd give it all just to hold you close
	Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

	[Verse 3]
	Never comin' down, uh
	I was running away from facin' reality, uh
	Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
	Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
	'Cause I want you, baby, uh
	I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
	It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
	I'll never let you down again, again

	[Chorus]
	Oh, baby
	Where are you now when I need you most?
	I'd give it all just to hold you close
	Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
	I said, baby
	I'll treat you better than I did before
	I'll hold you down and not let you go
	This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

	[Bridge]
	I know it's all my fault
	Made you put down your guard
	I know I made you fall
	Then said you were wrong for me
	I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
	Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
	You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
	'Cause this house is not a home

	[Chorus]
	Without my baby
	Where are you now when I need you most?
	I gave it all just to hold you close
	Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
	And I said, baby
	I'll treat you better than I did before
	I'll hold you down and not let you go
	This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no</pre>
